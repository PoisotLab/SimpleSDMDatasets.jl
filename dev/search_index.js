The default behavior of the interface is for the version on future data to fall back to the version for current data (i.e. we assume that future data are provided with the same format as current data). This means that most of the functions will not need to be overloaded when adding a provider with support for future data.","category":"page"},{"location":"dev/interface.html","page":"Interface","title":"Interface","text":"The interface is built around the idea that Julia will use the most specific version of a method first, and resort to the less generic ones when there are multiple matches. A good example is the BioClim dataset, provided by a number of sources, that often has different URLs and filenames. This is handled (in e.g. CHELSA2) by writing a method for the general case of any dataset RasterData{CHELSA2,T} (using a Union type), and then a specific method on RasterData{CHELSA2,BioClim}. In the case of CHELSA2, the general method handles all datasets except BioClim, which makes the code much easier to write and maintain.","category":"page"},{"location":"dev/interface.html#Compatibility-between-datasets-and-providers","page":"Interface","title":"Compatibility between datasets and providers","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"dev/interface.html","page":"Interface","title":"Interface","text":"The inner constructor for RasterData involves a call to provides, which must return true for the type to be constructed.
