Its purpose is to specify whether a specific dataset is provided by a specific provider. Note that this function takes two arguments, as opposed to a RasterData argument, because it is called in the inner constructor of RasterData: you cannot instantiate a RasterData with an incompatible provider/dataset combination.\n\nThe default value of this function is false, and to allow the use of a dataset with a provider, it is required to overload it for this specific pair so that it returns true.\n\n\n\n\n\nprovides(::R, ::F) where {R <: RasterData, F <: Future}\n\nThis method for provides specifies whether a RasterData combination has support for the value of the Future (a combination of a FutureScenario and a FutureModel) given as the second argument. Note that this function is not called as part of the Future constructor (because models and scenarios are messy and dataset dependent), but is still called when requesting data.\n\nThe default value of this function is false, and to allow the use of a future dataset with a given provider, it is required to overload it so that it returns true.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"index.html#SimpleSDMDatasets","page":"Index","title":"SimpleSDMDatasets","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Index","title":"Index","text":"The purpose of this package is to get raster datasets for use in biogeography work, retrieve them from online locations, and store them in a central location to avoid data duplication.
